## Consultation, Training and Advocacy

As well as being a support organisation and social group we have also delivered training and consultation to organisations such as the maternity and radiology service in Leeds as well as for various GPs practices, workplaces and networks.

## Resources

Non-Binary Leeds has produced some smaller resources and hand-outs to help explaing things such as a brief overview of what non-binary is and what a pronouns circle is.
When we create more resources for non-binary people and our allies we will endevour to store them here!

* [How to do a pronoun circle](/assets/pdf/pronoun-circles.pdf) (PDF)

## Non-Binary History Zines

In 2019 Non-Binary Leeds worked with the community to produce 2 history zines about non-binary people. One looking at more historical figures and another looking at what our current culture, feelings and experiences are in order to preserve them to look back on.

The zine project was led by Leo Adams, who ran several workshops for the community to make the zines and fill them with whatever content we wanted as a community. 
A limited print run of these were done for International Non-Binary and then published online here as a free downloadable resource.
